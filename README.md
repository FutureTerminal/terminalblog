# terminalblog
A blog website that put its focus on the your individual travels around the world

Idea: 

blogs structure by time: 

year -> month -> trips made in this month -> days in the trip -> number of blogs made in each day

Additionally: can sort each trip by location. An interactive map, part of the map changes color whenever you stayed in an area long enough or visit there frequently.
